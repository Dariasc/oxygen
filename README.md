# Oxygen

Oxygen is a work in progress Discord bot that interfaces with Rust's game servers using the same interface as the new **Rust+** companion app.

---

The plan is to include all features currently supported by the **Rust+** app.

- Map render with information on the game map including: monuments, events (crates, chinook), team location.
- Control in game smart devices.
- Receive updates from in game devices directly in your Discord channel.
- Team chat with friends ingame

## Self Host

Eventually this will be more complicated, for now this should be enough.

```
npm i
npm start
```

> Oxygen also requires a few environment variables, if you really want to test it out take a look through the code and see what is needed.
